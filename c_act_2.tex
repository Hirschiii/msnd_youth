{\bf Puck:} What's up, spirit! Where you going man?

{\bf Fairy:} \hskip-\leftskip \midaligned{
I’m running, jumping, through the trees, \\
Dodging bushes, cruising free, \\
Over fields, through crazy flames, \\
No chill—this life’s my game! \\
I roam ‘round faster than the moon, \\
Working for our fairy queen—boom! \\
I sprinkle dew on flowers, bling their style, \\
Got cowslips flexin’, gold coats wild. \\
The spots on ‘em? Ruby vibes, \\
Fairy swag where the magic hides. \\
Now I gotta grab some shiny dew, \\
And drop pearls on cowslips too. \\
Later, dude—I’m out, can’t stay, \\
The queen and squad are on their way! \\
}

{\bf Puck:}
