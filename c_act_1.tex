{\bf Theseus:} Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour \crlf
Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in \crlf
Another moon. But, O, methinks how slow \crlf
This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires \crlf
Like to a stepdame or a dowager \crlf
Long withering out a young man’s revenue.

Four nights will quickly dream away the time;\crlf
And then the moon, like to a silver bow\crlf
New -bent in heaven, shall behold the night\crlf
Of our solemnities.

{\bf Theseus:} Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments.\crlf
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.\crlf
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;\crlf
The pale companion is not for our pomp.\crlf
Hippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword\crlf
And won thy love doing thee injuries,\crlf
But I will wed thee in another key,\crlf
With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.
